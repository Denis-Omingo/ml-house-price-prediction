# House Price Prediction

This project is an end-to-end machine learning regression task that predicts house prices using the Ames Housing Dataset. The goal is to explore, clean, and model the data to generate accurate price estimates based on various features like location, area, construction year, number of rooms, and more.

- Built and executed in Google Colab

---

##  Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- Files used: `train.csv`

---

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib (for saving models)
- Google Colab (execution environment)

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized distribution of target variable `SalePrice`
- Correlation matrix to identify important predictors
- Handled missing data and outliers
- Encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding

##  Models Used

| Model              | Description                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression | Baseline model for quick training  |
| Random Forest     | Ensemble model for better accuracy |

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

Example output:
Linear Regression - RMSE: 33695.48, RÂ²: 0.84
Random Forest - RMSE: 27210.19, RÂ²: 0.90

##  How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-house-price-prediction.git
Open House_Price_Prediction.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Upload the dataset from Kaggle (train.csv).

Run all cells to explore and train models.

 Model Saving
The final Random Forest model is saved as house_price_model.pkl using joblib.

Can be reused in deployment apps using Streamlit or Flask.

 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning (e.g. GridSearchCV)

Model comparison with XGBoost or LightGBM

Web deployment via Streamlit

Improved feature selection techniques
